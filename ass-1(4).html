    <h1>Design with media Quary for different sizes...</h1>

    <P>
        Media queries, a cornerstone of responsive web design, allow developers to tailor website layouts and styles based on various device characteristics, ensuring a consistent and optimal user experience across different screen sizes and orientations. 

        Media queries are CSS rules that allow you to apply different styles based on conditions related to the user's device or browser. 
        
        They use the @media rule to specify conditions, such as screen width, height, orientation, or resolution, and then apply CSS styles only when those conditions are met.
